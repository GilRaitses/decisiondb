# No Triadic Serial Comma Operator

When three clauses or three items form a triad joined by ", and" before the final element, rephrase the third element using a different connector. The ", and" operator in a triad creates a rhythmic stall. Two-item conjunctions ("A and B") are unaffected by this rule.

## Three-clause triads

- BAD: "it loads the output, recomputes the hash, and checks the values"
- GOOD: "it loads the output, recomputes the hash, then checks the values"
- GOOD: "it loads the output and recomputes the hash before checking the values"

## Three-item noun triads

- BAD: "snapshots, representations, and decisions"
- GOOD: "snapshots, representations, decisions"
- GOOD: "snapshots, representations, as well as decisions"
- GOOD: "snapshots and representations alongside decisions"

## Replacement connectors for the third element

Use whichever fits the sentence logic: then, before, so as to, thereby, alongside, as well as, or simply drop the conjunction entirely.

## Not affected

Two-item conjunctions are normal and stay as-is: "content-addressed identifiers and immutable artifacts" is fine.
