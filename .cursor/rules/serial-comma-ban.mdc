# No Triadic Serial Comma Operator

When three clauses or three items form a triad joined by ", and" (comma followed by "and") before the final element, rephrase the third element using a different connector. The ", and" pattern in a triad creates a rhythmic stall.

## What is banned

The specific pattern: A, B, and C. The comma before "and" in a three-item list.

- BAD: "it loads the output, recomputes the hash, and checks the values"
- BAD: "snapshots, representations, and decisions"

## What is allowed

A normal "and" joining the last two items WITHOUT a preceding comma is standard grammar and required:

- GOOD: "a snapshot, an engine and a query"
- GOOD: "it loads the output, recomputes the hash, then checks the values"
- GOOD: "snapshots, representations, decisions"

Two-item conjunctions are always fine:

- GOOD: "content-addressed identifiers and immutable artifacts"

## Replacement connectors for the third element in triads

Use whichever fits: then, before, so as to, thereby, alongside, as well as, or drop the conjunction entirely and let the comma-separated list stand without a final connector.
