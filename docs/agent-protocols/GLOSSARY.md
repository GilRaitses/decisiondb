# Glossary of Core Terms

This glossary defines terms as they are used in this program.
Definitions are operational and scoped. Deviations must be explicit.

## Layer

A reusable abstraction that mediates between representations and outcomes, enabling systematic inspection, comparison, or control.

A layer:
- Is not a single algorithm or model
- Is not domain-specific
- Can be reused across tasks or implementations
- Admits tooling, inspection, or benchmarking

Examples: back-propagation, write-ahead logging, abstract data types.

---

## Representation

A concrete encoding of a problem, system, or dataset that is subject to variation.

Representations include:
- Parameterizations
- Data encodings
- Model architectures
- Analytic specifications
- Logging formats

Representations are inputs to a layer.

---

## Identity

A discrete, stable outcome produced by a system under a given representation.

Identities include:
- Selected routes
- Learned weight configurations
- Empirical conclusions
- Recovered system states
- Accepted models

Identity is not intention, agency, or decision-making psychology.

---

## Decision Identity

A specific form of identity corresponding to a choice among discrete alternatives.

The term “decision” is used in a mathematical and operational sense, not a psychological one.

---

## Stability

The persistence of identity under controlled variation of representation.

Stability does not imply optimality, correctness, or desirability.
It only refers to invariance properties.

---

## Representation Family

A structured set of related representations generated by varying parameters, encodings, or specifications.

Used to study how identity changes across a space of inputs.

---

## Solution Map

A mapping from a representation family to identity regions.

Often visualized as:
- Piecewise-constant regions
- Phase diagrams
- Stability surfaces

---

## Diagnostic Layer

A layer whose primary function is to reveal structure, sensitivity, or invariance rather than to optimize performance.

Examples include specification curves and cross-validation.

---

## Institutionalization

The process by which a layer becomes standardized through:
- Textbooks
- Libraries
- APIs
- Benchmarks
- Curricula

Institutionalization is distinct from invention.

---

## Unclaimed Layer

A layer that existed in practice before being named, formalized, or canonized.

“Unclaimed” does not imply novelty, ownership, or patentability.
