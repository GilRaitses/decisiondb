# Style and Framing Rules

These rules govern all documents, talks, proposals, and entries derived from this program.

They are designed to prevent category errors, hype, and misinterpretation.

---

## Allowed Language

- Representation
- Identity
- Mapping
- Layer
- Stability
- Invariance
- Parameter family
- Outcome
- Interface
- Diagnostic
- Abstraction

Use plain, technical language.

---

## Discouraged Language

Use only with explicit definition:

- Decision (must be qualified as “decision identity”)
- Phase (unless mathematically defined)
- Regime (use “region” or “identity region” instead)
- Selection (use “mapping” unless biological selection is intended)

---

## Banned Language

Do not use:

- Agent
- Intent
- Belief
- Preference
- Control (unless referring to control theory)
- Consciousness
- Alignment (unless formally defined)
- Identity transition (replaces politically overloaded alternatives)

---

## Framing Constraints

- Do not anthropomorphize systems.
- Do not claim ownership of abstractions.
- Do not frame the work as replacing existing methods.
- Do not describe the work as “the foundation of AI.”

The work identifies and formalizes a layer.
Nothing more.

---

## Claim Scope Rules

Allowed claims:
- Makes a latent structure explicit
- Enables systematic analysis
- Improves transparency or robustness
- Generalizes across domains

Disallowed claims:
- Guarantees safety
- Ensures correctness
- Solves alignment
- Controls intelligence

---

## Citation Rules

- Cite first formalization, not popularization alone.
- Distinguish practice from naming.
- Explicitly state what was *not* claimed historically.

---

## Diagram Rules

All diagrams must:
- Show representation variation explicitly
- Show identity regions or outcomes discretely
- Avoid arrows implying intention or agency

---

## Audience Safety Check

Before finalizing any text, ask:

“Could this be misread as a claim about agents, intentions, or control?”

If yes, rewrite.
