# Figure Conventions and Visual Grammar

This document defines mandatory conventions for all figures, diagrams, and visualizations.

The goal is to make representation-to-identity structure legible without implying agency, intent, or optimization.

---

## Purpose of Figures

Figures must do at least one of the following:
- Display variation across a representation family
- Show discrete identity regions
- Reveal stability or sensitivity boundaries
- Compare mappings across systems or domains

Figures must not:
- Illustrate internal cognition
- Imply deliberation or intention
- Suggest control or command flow

---

## Allowed Visual Elements

- Axes labeled with representation parameters
- Discrete regions or plateaus
- Piecewise-constant surfaces
- Step functions
- Region boundaries
- Heatmaps with explicitly defined scales
- Tables of mappings

---

## Discouraged Visual Elements

Use only with justification:
- Continuous gradients without identity labels
- Trajectories implying motion or search
- Animated transitions (unless explicitly diagnostic)

---

## Banned Visual Elements

Do not use:
- Human silhouettes
- Brain icons
- Arrows implying intent (“chooses,” “decides,” “wants”)
- Agent diagrams
- Feedback arrows labeled as goals or rewards
- Metaphorical imagery (phases as moods, regimes as governments)

---

## Identity Representation Rules

- Identities must be discrete and named
- Boundaries between identities must be explicit
- Ambiguous regions must be labeled as such

Example labels:
- Route A / Route B
- Model Class 1 / Model Class 2
- Outcome + / Outcome −

---

## Phase and Region Language

If phase-like structure is shown:
- Use “identity region”
- Use “boundary”
- Use “transition surface”

Do not label figures as:
- Phase change
- Identity transition
- Critical transition

Unless mathematically defined in the caption.

---

## Caption Requirements

Every figure caption must state:
1. What is varied (representation)
2. What is held fixed
3. What identity is observed
4. What stability or sensitivity is illustrated

Captions must be complete sentences.

---

## Color Rules

- Color encodes identity, not value
- Legends are mandatory
- Avoid red/green contrasts where possible
- No emotional color coding

---

## Review Check

Before including a figure, confirm:
- Could this be misread as a model of agency?
- Could this be read as claiming control?
- Does it add information beyond the text?

If yes to the first two, revise.
