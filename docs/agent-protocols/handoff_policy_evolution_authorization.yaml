scope: policy-evolution
status: LIMITED_AUTHORIZATION

purpose:
  Establish a safe, auditable mechanism for introducing or revising equivalence
  policies without affecting existing decisions, replay guarantees, or execution
  behavior.

explicit_authorization:
  allowed:
    - Create new policy documentation artifacts.
    - Register a new policy as DRAFT or FROZEN in the policy registry.
    - Declare lineage relationships between policies (parent_policy_id).
    - Perform read-only analysis of existing decisions to assess compatibility.
  forbidden:
    - Any decision persistence.
    - Any f_map persistence.
    - Any engine execution.
    - Any replay verification framed as PASS under a different policy than the one
      bound to the decision.
    - Any modification to existing frozen policy definitions.
    - Any network access of any kind.

preconditions:
  - validate_unlock.py passes with exit code 0 in non-strict mode.
  - At least one Growth Cycle is fully closed:
      - execution → decision → replay PASS
  - All referenced policies are content-addressed and immutable once frozen.

policy_constraints:
  policy_states:
    - DRAFT
    - FROZEN
  rules:
    - Semantic changes require a new policy_id.
    - Frozen policies may not be edited in place.
    - Cross-policy replay is forbidden in v1.
    - Policy compatibility claims must be explicitly stated and justified.

authorization_scope:
  policy_count: explicit (must be enumerated in exec report)
  decision_impact: none
  replay_impact: none

success_criteria:
  - New or revised policy artifacts exist and are internally consistent.
  - Policy lineage is explicitly documented.
  - No changes occur to decisions, f_map, engine_runs, snapshots, or representations.
  - Exec report clearly states whether the policy remains DRAFT or is FROZEN.

required_outputs:
  - Work-tree log documenting policy analysis and creation.
  - Exec report summarizing policy identifiers, lineage, and state.
