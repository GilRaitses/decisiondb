Dear Members of the Review Committee,

Please find enclosed a manuscript describing a research project focused on diagnostic infrastructure for complex analytical systems. The work introduces a minimal, auditable framework for examining how representational choices influence discrete outcomes, without relying on performance benchmarks or learning claims.

This research emphasizes methodological clarity, reproducibility, and system-level transparency, with the goal of enabling more rigorous evaluation of analytical pipelines in scientific and technical settings. I believe the project aligns well with the aims of the graduate research awards program in supporting foundational, high-integrity research.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Gil Raitses
