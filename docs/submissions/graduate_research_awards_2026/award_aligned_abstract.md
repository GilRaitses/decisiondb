Complex analytical pipelines routinely produce discrete outcome identities whose dependence on representational choices remains implicit and difficult to audit. This work formalizes decision-valued maps as a diagnostic object for making such dependencies observable and testable. A minimal infrastructure is introduced for logging, replaying, and auditing the mapping from representation families to discrete decision identities under fixed snapshots and engines. Using canonical representational sweeps, the method empirically characterizes regions of identity persistence and boundary formation in representation space. The contribution is infrastructural rather than performance-driven: it provides a system-level abstraction for studying representational dependence without introducing performance targets, learning dynamics, or outcome-improvement claims.
