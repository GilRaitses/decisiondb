This research develops diagnostic infrastructure for understanding how representational choices shape discrete outcomes in complex analytical systems. Rather than optimizing performance or proposing new learning methods, the work focuses on making representational dependence empirically observable through replayable, auditable mappings from representation families to decision identities. By formalizing these mappings and introducing a minimal system for logging and replay, the project enables systematic investigation of stability, boundary formation, and sensitivity in analytical pipelines. The resulting framework supports transparent evaluation of analytical behavior and provides a foundation for governance-aware system design in scientific and technical contexts.
