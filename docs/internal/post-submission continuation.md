post-submission continuation.md
You’re in a good place to cut cleanly into the next phase. Below is a handoff block you can paste verbatim into a brand-new ChatGPT thread. It is written to preserve constraints, context, and momentum without dragging the whole operational history along.

I’ll answer one lingering question first, because it affects tone going forward:

The colon in the title is acceptable for peer review and dissertation contexts.
For public-facing material, I would drop it. Colons read academic and invite taxonomy parsing. Public pages benefit from a single declarative title. So keep it in the paper, remove it everywhere else.

Now the handoff.

🔁 New-Thread Handoff: Post-Submission Continuation

Context Snapshot (read first)

This project is DecisionDB / Decision-Valued Maps, a diagnostic infrastructure for making representational dependence empirically observable.
	•	A U.S. provisional patent has been filed.
	•	The manuscript is fully frozen, audited, and tagged:
	•	Git tag: submission-ready-2026-01-24
	•	Peer-review and graduate award submission packages are complete.
	•	All first-person language has been removed and is guarded by pre-commit hooks.
	•	No optimization, learning, or performance claims are made anywhere in the canonical work.
	•	Anything public must be patent-safe and non-disclosing.

You are now operating after submission, not revising it.

⸻

Canonical Artifacts (do not modify)
	•	decisiondb_manuscript_peer_review.pdf
	•	peer_review_cover.pdf
	•	Layout and content are frozen as of 2026-01-24.

Objectives for This New Thread

You are to help with three forward-facing but constrained tasks:

⸻

1. Draft a Public-Facing Project Page (Patent-Safe)

Goal:
Create a website-ready “Project Overview” that explains what this is and why it exists without disclosing implementation details or enabling reconstruction.

Constraints:
	•	No equations
	•	No protocol steps
	•	No figures
	•	No optimization or learning language
	•	No claim that outcomes improve
	•	Language must be compatible with an active provisional patent

Tone:
	•	Diagnostic, infrastructural
	•	Calm, precise
	•	Accessible to technically literate readers outside the subfield

Deliverables:
	•	One short headline
	•	One 1–2 paragraph overview
	•	One short “What this is / What this is not” section

⸻

2. Turn the Minimal Example into a Teaching Artifact

Goal:
Re-express the idea of the minimal example as something teachable without exposing the operational pipeline.

This is for:
	•	Classroom explanation
	•	Whiteboard talks
	•	Blog readers
	•	Early-stage students

Constraints:
	•	No system names
	•	No database language
	•	No identifiers or hashes
	•	No replay or logging mechanics
	•	No “run this” instructions

Acceptable framing:
	•	Thought experiment
	•	Conceptual diagram (described in words)
	•	“Imagine two representations…” style

Deliverables:
	•	A short conceptual narrative
	•	A clean bullet-point breakdown suitable for slides
	•	A short paragraph titled “Why this example matters”

⸻

3. Map the Work into a Dissertation Chapter Scaffold

Goal:
Show how this paper becomes a chapter, not an appendix.

Constraints:
	•	The manuscript itself is unchanged
	•	The dissertation can contextualize before and after

What to produce:
	•	A proposed dissertation chapter outline where this work fits
	•	Suggested preceding chapter (what prepares the reader)
	•	Suggested following chapter (what this enables)
	•	Notes on what new material would be appropriate in a dissertation version vs. what must remain cited to the paper

⸻

Explicit Non-Goals (Do Not Do These)
	•	Do not revise the paper
	•	Do not suggest new experiments
	•	Do not add claims
	•	Do not weaken patent posture
	•	Do not introduce “we,” “I,” or “our”

⸻

Style Guardrails
	•	Declarative sentences
	•	No marketing language
	•	No hype
	•	No colons in public-facing titles
	•	Treat the reader as intelligent but not invested yet

⸻

Status Statement You May Reuse

“This work is shared for informational and educational purposes.
The underlying research is protected by a filed U.S. provisional patent application.
Public materials are intentionally non-operational.”

⸻

First Task to Start With

Begin with Task 1: Public-Facing Project Overview, then proceed in order.

⸻

If you paste the above into a new chat, the next assistant should be able to pick up exactly where you are: submission complete, posture stable, moving outward carefully.

It’s been a pleasure helping you shepherd this across the line. This is the rare case where rigor and restraint actually compound.
