terminology_policy:
  purpose: >
    Standardize language across specs, grants, papers, and repositories
    to prevent agentic, political, or theoretical drift and to ensure
    EPO- and NSF-safe framing.

  allowed:
    - term: persistence
      use: >
        Describes conditional continuation of an outcome identity under
        variation.
      notes: >
        Prefer "persistence under representation variation" or
        "conditional persistence".

    - term: outcome identity
      use: >
        Discrete identity selected by a resolution procedure.
      notes: >
        Default noun phrase for all core objects.

    - term: resolution
      use: >
        A procedure that maps a representation to a discrete outcome.
      notes: >
        Non-agentic, non-learning, suitable for biological, computational,
        and analytical systems.

    - term: resolution procedure
      use: >
        The invariant mapping mechanism used for comparison across
        representations.
      notes: >
        May be algorithmic, biological, statistical, or formal.

    - term: representation variation
      use: >
        Changes in encoding, parameterization, feature space, or abstraction.
      notes: >
        Treated as an experimental axis, not noise.

    - term: conditional
      use: >
        Explicitly signals dependence on stated constraints or invariants.
      notes: >
        Use to avoid implied universality.

    - term: mapping
      use: >
        Structural relation between representations and outcome identities.
      notes: >
        Safe and neutral across domains.

    - term: fixed engine
      use: >
        A computational procedure held constant during analysis, consuming
        representations and producing raw output.
      notes: >
        Core invariant assumption in DecisionDB. Engine configuration and
        version are fixed across representational sweeps.

  discouraged:
    - term: stability
      reason: >
        Implies equilibrium, robustness, or control-theoretic guarantees.
      replacement: persistence
      notes: >
        If used, must be explicitly defined as shorthand for persistence.

    - term: decision
      reason: >
        Sounds agent-centric or psychological without qualification.
      replacement: outcome identity or resolved identity
      notes: >
        May appear in compound terms only if defined formally.

    - term: regime
      reason: >
        Carries political and dynamical-systems connotations.
      replacement: outcome identity or identity region
      notes: >
        Acceptable only as a derived analogy in explanatory text.

    - term: state
      reason: >
        Suggests continuous dynamics rather than discrete identity.
      replacement: outcome identity
      notes: >
        Avoid unless explicitly modeling continuous systems.

    - term: learning
      reason: >
        Implies adaptation or training over time.
      replacement: resolution or inference
      notes: >
        Learning systems may be analyzed, but the framework itself is not
        a learning method.

  banned:
    - term: regime change
      reason: >
        Political meaning overwhelms technical intent.
      replacement: identity transition or identity boundary

    - term: induction
      reason: >
        Incorrectly frames the method as a learning process.
      replacement: resolution or inference

  restricted:
    - term: decision-making
      reason: >
        Anthropomorphic connotation; avoid in normative or algorithmic claims.
      allowed_context: >
        Permitted when describing what the framework does NOT do, or when
        explicitly tied to decision identity as a formal object.
      notes: >
        Example allowed: "not a decision-making rule"
        Example banned: "improves decision-making"

  enforcement:
    scope:
      - specs
      - grant abstracts
      - award narratives
      - repositories
      - figures
    rule: >
      Discouraged terms must be justified inline.
      Banned terms must not appear.
    tooling_hint: >
      Enforce via pre-commit hooks, doc linting, or CI checks.

  canonical_core_sentence: >
    The work studies the persistence of discrete outcome identities under
    representation variation, conditional on an invariant resolution procedure.
