Here are both versions, written to do different kinds of work and not step on each other.

First, Phase 2.5 side-study justification. This is internal, methodological, and meant to justify why this is worth doing now without expanding scope.

Phase 2.5 uses biological condensate models as a controlled reference system for testing whether reuse admissibility can be determined from context alone. Synaptic condensates provide a setting where fast events operate under slow, measurable material constraints, allowing explicit separation between instantaneous signals and latent state. By simulating condensate phase trajectories and vesicle routing under fixed stimulation while varying only slow physical parameters, this side study evaluates whether incompatibility arises when required context is absent, even when downstream signals remain stable. The purpose is not biological prediction, but validation of a general principle already established in Phase 2: that confidence and evidence reuse become uninterpretable when the conditions under which they were formed are no longer represented. Condensates serve as a physically grounded test case for that principle before extending it to broader decision substrates.

Second, provisional-patent background language. This is broader, more general, and framed as a problem statement rather than a solution claim.

Many decision and inference systems rely on fast signals whose validity depends on slower, latent conditions that are not explicitly represented. In biological systems, synaptic condensates exemplify this structure, as material state variables such as viscosity, crosslinking, and spatial organization govern vesicle availability and learning without being directly observable in individual events. Changes in these latent conditions can render prior signals inadmissible, even when signal magnitude or apparent confidence remains unchanged. Existing computational systems lack a general mechanism for tracking and enforcing such context dependencies, leading to reuse of evidence outside its domain of validity. This work is motivated by the need for decision substrates that explicitly encode the conditions under which evidence is formed, reused, and invalidated, enabling systematic auditing of decision validity across time, representations, and operating regimes.

If you want a very compact bridge sentence you can reuse in both contexts, this one works cleanly:

“Biological condensates provide a concrete system in which decision validity depends on slow, latent context rather than signal strength alone.”

That sentence is safe, accurate, and does not overclaim.
