# Trajectory Template for Structural Layers

This document defines the reusable schema for tracking how latent practices become named, adopted, and institutionalized layers.

## Core Trajectory Knobs

1. Latent practice  
What practitioners did without naming or formalizing it.

2. Naming event  
The publication, memo, or artifact that made the practice legible.

3. Operational pressure  
The crisis, bottleneck, or scaling limit that forced attention.

4. Tooling shift  
What made systematic exploration feasible.

5. Institutional channel  
How the layer entered curricula, libraries, or standards.

6. Artifact form  
The stable object the layer takes: interface, log, diagram, benchmark, or schema.

## Quality Checks

- The layer must separate representation from identity or outcome.
- The layer must be reusable across multiple contexts.
- The layer must admit testing, inspection, or comparison.
- The layer must survive changes in underlying implementation.

## Anti-Patterns

- Domain-specific hacks with no transferability.
- Pure algorithms without interface or abstraction boundaries.
- Naming without adoption or institutional uptake.

## Usage

Use this template for:
- New Soundboard Pack entries
- Workshop submissions
- Methodological papers
- Internal research logs
