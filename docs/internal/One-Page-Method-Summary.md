This program studies a recurring structural layer that appears across scientific and engineering domains: the mapping from families of representations to discrete outcome identities.

Rather than proposing new models or algorithms, the work formalizes how outcomes persist or change as representations vary.

---

## Core Object of Study

The central object is a mapping:

Representation Family → Identity

where:
- A representation family is a structured set of parameterizations, encodings, or specifications
- An identity is a discrete, observable outcome produced by a system

The focus is on how identity behaves under controlled variation of representation.

---

## Key Question

Under what conditions does identity remain stable, fragment, or transition as representations change?

This question appears implicitly across domains, but is rarely named or studied directly.

---

## Methodological Contribution

The program:
- Makes representation-to-identity mappings explicit
- Defines stability as invariance of identity under representation variation
- Provides diagnostic tools for inspecting these mappings

This is a diagnostic layer, not an optimization method.

---

## Historical Precedent

Multiple fields independently developed similar layers:
- Parametric shortest-path solution maps
- Write-ahead logging
- Abstract data types
- Specification curves
- Back-propagation
- Version control
- Cross-validation
- Differential privacy
- Model cards

In each case, a latent practice was later named, formalized, and institutionalized.

---

## Generality

The framework applies across:
- Biological systems
- Machine learning
- Optimization
- Software systems
- Statistical inference

The abstraction is substrate-independent and implementation-agnostic.

---

## Outputs

Planned outputs include:
- A formal definition of representation-to-identity mappings
- Diagnostic visualizations and benchmarks
- Open-source tooling for logging and analysis
- Teaching modules and case studies

---

## Scope and Limits

This work does not:
- Model cognition or agency
- Claim control or safety guarantees
- Replace existing algorithms
- Propose a unified framework for intelligence

It provides a shared language and toolkit for analyzing stability in complex systems.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Success is measured by:
- Clarity of the abstraction
- Reproducibility of mappings
- Cross-domain adoption
- Usefulness as a diagnostic layer
