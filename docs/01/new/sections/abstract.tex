Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcomes whose dependence on representational choices is rarely made explicit, complicating reproducibility and downstream reuse. Given a single graph snapshot and one computational engine, varying a representation parameter can leave the outcome unchanged. Varying a different parameter under the same query yields an entirely different answer. A decision-valued map captures this relationship, recording which outcome each representation produces so the dependence becomes an observable, storable object. This paper formalizes the concept and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays, audits these maps by assigning identifiers computed from content to every artifact stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each stored decision identifier exactly, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution is infrastructural, partitioning representation space into persistence regions and boundaries and treating decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.
