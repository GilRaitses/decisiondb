\begin{abstract}
Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcomes whose dependence on representational choices is rarely recorded or tested. A decision-valued map records which discrete outcome a fixed engine produces under each member of a declared family of representations, making that dependence an observable, storable object. This paper formalizes the concept and describes DecisionDB, a minimal infrastructure for logging, replaying, auditing such maps using content-addressed identifiers, immutable artifacts, declared equivalence policies. In a concrete decision setting on a fixed graph snapshot, two representation parameters are swept under a fixed computational engine. Sweeping the neighbor weight leaves decision identity unchanged across the tested range, while sweeping the second-order weight produces a boundary where the engine returns a distinct output path under identical query conditions. Deterministic replay recovers each decision identifier from its stored artifacts, establishing that the recorded context fully specifies the outcome. The contribution is infrastructural, establishing a system-level abstraction that partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.
