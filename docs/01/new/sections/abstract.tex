Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcomes whose dependence on representational choices is rarely made explicit. On a fixed graph snapshot with a fixed computational engine, sweeping one representation parameter preserves the discrete outcome while sweeping another produces a different outcome under identical query conditions. A decision-valued map records these relationships, treating the dependence of outcome on representation as an observable, storable object. This paper formalizes the concept and describes DecisionDB, a minimal infrastructure that logs, replays, audits such maps using content-addressed identifiers, immutable artifacts, declared equivalence policies. Deterministic replay recovers each decision identifier from its stored artifacts, establishing that the recorded context fully specifies the outcome. The contribution is infrastructural, establishing a system-level abstraction that partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.
