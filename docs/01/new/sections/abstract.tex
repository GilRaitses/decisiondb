\begin{abstract}
Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcomes whose dependence on representational choices is rarely recorded or tested. We formalize decision-valued maps as a diagnostic object that makes this dependence observable: a mapping $f\colon\mathcal{R}\to\mathcal{D}$ from a family of representations to discrete decision identities, evaluated under a fixed data snapshot and a fixed computational engine. We describe DecisionDB, a minimal infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing such maps using content-addressed identifiers, immutable artifacts, and declared equivalence policies. In a concrete routing domain, we sweep two representation parameters across a fixed graph snapshot and fixed shortest-path engine. One parameter (neighbor weight) preserves route identity across its tested range; the other (second-order weight) induces a boundary where route identity changes. Independent replay verification confirms that persisted decision identifiers are deterministically recoverable from stored artifacts. The contribution is infrastructural: a system-level abstraction that partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries without introducing performance targets, learning dynamics, or outcome-improvement claims.
