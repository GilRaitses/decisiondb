\section{Problem Scope}

Decision-valued mapping addresses systems with the following structure. A \emph{snapshot} $s$ is a frozen slice of external inputs over a declared time window; any change to the world state produces a new snapshot. A \emph{representation} $r \in \mathcal{R}(s)$ is a deterministic encoding of $s$, defined by explicit structural choices such as kernels, thresholds, weighting rules and aggregation policies; each representation is fully specified by a declared parameter set and generated by a versioned factory. An \emph{engine} $E$ is a computational procedure that consumes a representation and produces raw output, with engine configuration and version held constant during analysis. An \emph{equivalence policy} $\pi$ is a declared rule that reduces raw engine output to a discrete \emph{decision identity} $d \in \mathcal{D}$, defining when two raw outputs correspond to the same identity independent of incidental numerical differences.

Varying the representation while holding the snapshot, engine and query constant reveals where decision identity persists and where it changes. The central question is whether a previously produced decision remains admissible when the representation that supported it is altered. Persistence and boundary formation are treated as properties of the computational setting. Continuous outputs are in scope only when reduced to discrete identities via a declared policy. The map does not introduce training procedures, adaptive updates, gradient-based optimization or online learning.

This framing applies wherever discrete outcomes emerge from complex pipelines and representational choices may influence those outcomes. Routing evaluated under alternative cost encodings, classification evaluated under alternative feature constructions and resource allocation evaluated under alternative aggregation rules all exhibit the same structural question.
