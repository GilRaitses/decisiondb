\section{Conclusion}

In a graph routing demonstration, one representation parameter preserves decision identity across its tested range while another induces a discrete identity change. DecisionDB materializes this structure through a five-stage sweep protocol, a five-table relational schema and a replay verification procedure that recovers all persisted identifiers exactly.

The approach is limited by its restriction to discrete outcomes, its reliance on held-constant snapshots and engines, the narrow empirical coverage reported here. A natural extension is to densify the parameter sweep, apply the same protocol across additional domains, introduce a cross-snapshot comparison procedure that treats ``same query, different snapshot'' as an explicit axis of reuse admissibility.

The contribution of this work is infrastructural, introducing a diagnostic layer that records how discrete decisions arise from families of representations. Decision-valued maps expose stability and fracture directly, allowing downstream reuse to be conditioned on explicit representational context rather than on confidence or performance summaries alone. Decision reuse becomes a compatibility question that can be checked mechanically before deployment across tasks and timescales.
