\begin{abstract}
An analytical pipeline consumes a data snapshot through a computational engine and produces a discrete outcome. When the same snapshot and engine are held constant, changing the internal representation can leave that outcome intact. Changing a different representation parameter, under identical query conditions, can produce an entirely different outcome.

A decision-valued map records this relationship by associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete outcome it produces, making outcome identity across representation space an explicit object of analysis.

This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, a minimal infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing them using content-addressed identifiers, immutable artifacts, and declared equivalence policies. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, establishing that outcome identity is fully specified by the preserved context.

The contribution is infrastructural, establishing a system-level abstraction that partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.
