\begin{abstract}
Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcomes whose dependence on representational choices is rarely recorded or tested. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps as a diagnostic object that makes this dependence observable, defining a mapping $f\colon\mathcal{R}\to\mathcal{D}$ from a family of representations to discrete decision identities, evaluated under a fixed data snapshot and a fixed computational engine. DecisionDB is a minimal infrastructure for logging, replaying, auditing such maps using content-addressed identifiers, immutable artifacts, declared equivalence policies. In a concrete decision setting on a fixed graph snapshot, two representation parameters are swept under a fixed computational engine. Sweeping the neighbor weight leaves decision identity unchanged across the tested range, while sweeping the second-order weight produces a boundary where identity transitions. Deterministic replay recovers each decision identifier from its stored artifacts, establishing that the recorded context fully specifies the outcome. The contribution is infrastructural, establishing a system-level abstraction that partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.
