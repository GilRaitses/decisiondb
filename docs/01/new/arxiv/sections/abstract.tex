Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcomes whose dependence on representational choices is rarely recorded or tested. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps as a diagnostic object that makes this dependence observable, defining a mapping $f\colon\mathcal{R}\to\mathcal{D}$ from a family of representations to discrete decision identities, evaluated under a fixed data snapshot and a fixed computational engine. DecisionDB is a minimal infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing such maps using content-addressed identifiers, immutable artifacts, and declared equivalence policies. In a concrete routing domain, two representation parameters are swept across a fixed graph snapshot and fixed shortest-path engine. The neighbor weight parameter preserves route identity across its tested range; the second-order weight parameter induces a boundary where route identity changes. Independent replay verification confirms that persisted decision identifiers are deterministically recoverable from stored artifacts. The contribution is infrastructural, providing a system-level abstraction that partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries without introducing performance targets, learning dynamics, or outcome-improvement claims.
