Data sanity checks summary (2026-01-15 to 2026-01-16)

Scope
This summary captures the data sanity checks and stress activation diagnostics recorded in:
- /Users/gilraitses/decisiondb/docs/logs/2026-01-15-processed-data-audit.yaml
- /Users/gilraitses/decisiondb/docs/logs/2026-01-15.yaml
- /Users/gilraitses/decisiondb/docs/logs/2026-01-16.yaml

Key findings
- stress_scores_updated.json contains normalized_stress for 82 cameras and mean_stress is missing.
- Any consumer that reads mean_stress only will see zeros, which explains the zero stress coverage results in the initial audit.
- Using normalized_stress yields nonzero propagation through zones, intersections, and edges, with nonzero edge penalties and nonzero total_stress.

Canonical decision
- Treat normalized_stress in data/stress_scores_updated.json as the canonical field unless mean_stress is regenerated and documented.

Activation evidence
- Stress activation trace and summaries show nonzero edge stress and route total_stress when normalized_stress is used.
- Activated perturbation runs on 2026-01-16 confirm stable use of normalized_stress and produce nonzero results for both neighbor_weight and second_order_weight sweeps.
