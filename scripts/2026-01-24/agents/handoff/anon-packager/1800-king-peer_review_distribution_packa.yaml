objective:
  description: >
    Create a separate peer-review sharing package, distinct from
    graduate research awards materials, suitable for controlled
    academic circulation.

tasks:
  - Create directory:
      path: docs/submissions/peer_review/
      constraints:
        - do not modify existing graduate_research_awards_2026 directory
        - additive only

  - Populate peer_review directory with:
      files:
        - decisiondb_manuscript_peer_review.pdf
        - peer_review_context.md
        - peer_review_sharing_note.md

  - peer_review_context.md must include:
      - one-paragraph technical summary (drawn from manuscript abstract)
      - clarification that this is a diagnostic infrastructure paper
      - explicit statement: no performance, learning, or optimization claims
      - note that layout and content are frozen

  - peer_review_sharing_note.md must include:
      - intended audience: trusted academic peers only
      - request not to redistribute
      - notice that the work is covered by a filed U.S. provisional patent
      - neutral, non-legal tone (informational, not restrictive)

constraints:
  - No edits to manuscript text or figures
  - No abstract substitution
  - No language implying public release
  - No claims beyond what appears in the manuscript
  - Must pass patent-safe language check

verification:
  - SHA256 hash of PDF matches canonical
  - Directory contains exactly 3 files
  - No references to awards or internal governance language
