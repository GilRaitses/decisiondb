scope: replay-verification
status: LIMITED_AUTHORIZATION

purpose:
  Verify deterministic replay for a single materialized decision under a
  single declared equivalence policy, without modifying any system state.

explicit_authorization:
  allowed:
    - Replay verification for one decision identity.
    - Hash recomputation and comparison against persisted artifacts.
    - Read-only access to experiment outputs, manifests, and database state.
  forbidden:
    - Any engine execution.
    - Any database writes of any kind.
    - Any modification to decisions, f_map, or engine_runs.
    - Any policy changes or reinterpretation.
    - Network access of any kind.

preconditions:
  - validate_unlock.py passes with exit code 0 in non-strict mode.
  - Decision materialization completed and documented.
  - decision_id: dec_e28092c4dc33b8f1
  - equivalence_policy_id: pol_d8da3e00e9584eb1
  - experiment_id: exp_20260124T102432Z

authorization_scope:
  decision_limit: 1
  experiment_limit: 1
  replay_mode: deterministic_only

success_criteria:
  - Replay recomputes identical decision identity.
  - Payload hash matches persisted decision payload hash.
  - No additional rows appear in any database table.
  - Replay verdict is explicitly PASS or FAIL with evidence.

required_outputs:
  - Work-tree log documenting replay inputs and verification steps.
  - Exec report stating replay verdict, hashes compared, and policy used.

notes:
  This handoff does NOT authorize new execution, new persistence,
  or expansion beyond the single named decision.
  Any failure must be reported without corrective action.
