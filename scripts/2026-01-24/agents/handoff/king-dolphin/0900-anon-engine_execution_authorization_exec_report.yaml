summary: |
  Task blocked per selection_rule. No existing representation satisfies both
  constraints: (1) compatible with PaxEngineAdapter and (2) has not yet produced
  a successful engine_run with raw_output.

  conclusion: |
    The only representation without a successful run (repr_ee6d8f5a57ffe120) is a
    validation-type representation created by run_persist.py. It lacks start_node
    and end_node fields required by PaxEngineAdapter.run(). All representations
    compatible with PaxEngineAdapter have already produced successful engine_runs
    with raw_output present.

  decisions_written: 0
  f_map_written: 0
  policy_changes: 0
  schema_changes: 0
  new_representations_created: 0
  within_bounds: true

recommended_resolution: |
  To proceed, one of the following would be required (each requires separate authorization):
  1. Create a new representation with start_node/end_node (violates new_representations: forbidden)
  2. Modify existing validation representation to add start_node/end_node (violates no-modification constraint)
  3. Expand scope to consider probe artifact files as eligible representations (would require handoff amendment)

notes: |
  Per handoff selection_rule: "If none exist, STOP and report BLOCKED."
  No improvisation attempted. Execution halted at analysis phase.
