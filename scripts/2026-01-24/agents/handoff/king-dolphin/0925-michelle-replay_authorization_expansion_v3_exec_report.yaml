task: Replay verification for all decisions after forward growth

verdict: PASS

summary: |
  Replay verification confirms deterministic identity computation for all 3
  persisted decisions under the frozen equivalence policy, including the
  newly materialized forward-growth decision. All hashes recompute identically.
  Reproducibility verified across multiple runs. Decision materialization
  remains stable as the system grows forward.

  result: PASS
  note: |
    The forward-growth decision was materialized from a new engine execution
    and verifies correctly under the same policy as all prior decisions.
    This confirms that decision materialization remains stable as the
    execution frontier advances.

notes:
  - All verification performed read-only
  - No engine execution, database writes, or policy modifications
  - Determinism confirmed across 3 decisions under single equivalence policy
  - Forward growth decision included and verified successfully
  - System identity guarantees hold as execution frontier advances
