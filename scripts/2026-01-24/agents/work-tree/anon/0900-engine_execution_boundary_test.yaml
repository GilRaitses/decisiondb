task: |
  Create exactly one new successful engine_runs row with raw_output present,
  with no decision writes, no f_map writes, no policy changes, and no schema
  changes. If no existing representation qualifies, stop and report BLOCKED.

    action: "STOP per selection_rule"
    reason: "No eligible representation found; improvisation forbidden"

blocking_cause: |
  repr_ee6d8f5a57ffe120 is the only representation without a successful run,
  but its spec is {"type":"validation",...} with no start_node/end_node.
  PaxEngineAdapter.run() requires start_node and end_node to execute pathfinding.
  
  All other representations (cb9f8c1d418c4678, repr_validation_first_engine)
  have already produced successful engine_runs with raw_output present.

outputs:
  engine_run_id: null
  experiment_id: null
  representation_id: null
  policy_id: pol_d8da3e00e9584eb1
  raw_output_hash: null
