This manuscript now closes with a concrete specification for a decision-valued map of the form
$f : R \rightarrow D$ that is intended to make representation choices and routing outcomes
reproducible, auditable, and queryable. The outcome of the 2026-01-15 to 2026-01-20 work window
is a minimal, implementable design for a logging and analysis subsystem that records how each
representation of a frozen snapshot yields a discrete decision identity under a fixed engine.

The specification defines strict identifiers for snapshots, representations, engine runs, and
decisions using canonical JSON hashing, and it separates representation parameters from engine
tuning. It fixes a minimal schema for snapshots, representations, engine runs, decisions, and
the $f$ map, with artifact references and policy versions captured for auditability. It also
declares a minimal directory layout and a first experiment that sweeps a representation family
to verify nontrivial decision diversity and repeatability. Required analysis outputs include
decision counts, flip edges across neighbors, and connected components per decision identity.

Taken together, these changes convert the prior planning narrative into an executable, testable
contract. The manuscript should be read as the baseline for implementation, with the conclusion
anchoring the data model, identity rules, and experiment criteria that define the system outcome
for this phase of work.
