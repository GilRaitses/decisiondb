deviation_flags:
  content_modified: false
  terminology_changed: false
  new_claims_introduced: false
  interpretation_added: false

drift_risk:
  level: low
  notes:
    - Section titles renamed to match structure doc exactly
    - Invariants relocated verbatim from system_design.tex
    - No prose added to new sections beyond TODO comments
    - empirical_characterization.tex retained as supplementary material

ambiguity_encountered:
  - issue: "deep_research_alignment_findings.yaml not found"
    resolution: "Used decisiondb_manuscript_structure.md as authoritative source for section order"

  - issue: "empirical_characterization.tex not in structure doc"
    resolution: "Retained after protocol section; content describes sweep methodology"

  - issue: "limitations.tex content vs 'Failure Modes' title mismatch"
    resolution: "Renamed section header only; content preserved verbatim"

confidence_in_alignment:
  structural_match: high
  terminology_compliance: high
  scope_compliance: high
  notes:
    - Section order now matches structure doc sections 0-11
    - All required sections present (some with TODO placeholders)
    - Working notes (figure_captions, figure_placeholders) commented out

glossary_compliance:

  modification_applied: false
  status: unchanged

scope_compliance:
  ai_claims: none
  learning_language: none
  cognition_language: none
  optimization_claims: none

structural_decisions_made:
  - decision: extract_invariants
    rationale: Structure doc specifies standalone "System Invariants" section

  - decision: retain_empirical_characterization
    rationale: Contains sweep methodology not duplicated elsewhere

  - decision: rename_section_titles_only
    rationale: Per constraint "do NOT modify terminology definitions"

  - decision: comment_out_working_notes
    rationale: figure_captions and figure_placeholders are not in structure doc
