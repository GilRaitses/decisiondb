# Unlock Decision Memo  
**Date:** 2026-01-23  
**Project:** DecisionDB

## Decision Summary

- **Manuscript agent (Roland):** UNLOCKED (mechanics only)
- **Coding / experimental agent:** NOT UNLOCKED

This decision is based on an architecture review, deep-research positioning assessment, and verification of repository governance mechanisms.

## Basis for Decision

### 1. Conceptual and Historical Alignment

A deep-research review conducted using the manuscript alone confirms that DecisionDB is consistently framed as a **diagnostic infrastructure**, historically aligned with abstractions such as Abstract Data Types, Write-Ahead Logging, and specification-curve analysis.

The manuscript:
- Fixes the computational engine
- Defines decision identity via declared equivalence policies
- Excludes learning, optimization, adaptation, and performance guarantees
- Positions persistence and boundary analysis as descriptive diagnostics

This framing is stable and does not require revision before manuscript completion.

---

### 2. Governance Readiness

Repository safeguards are in place and verified:

- Pre-commit hook enforces:
  - terminology discipline
  - stylistic constraints
  - scope and overclaim prevention
  - patent-safe language
  - figure metadata requirements
- These safeguards prevent drift during manuscript completion.

---

### 3. Manuscript Status

The manuscript is structurally coherent but incomplete:
- Abstract is empty
- Example route section is a placeholder
- Conclusion is a placeholder

These sections must be completed **without empirical claims** before any experimental work begins.

Roland’s scope is therefore restricted to:
- section ordering
- placeholder insertion
- abstract drafting (non-empirical)
- compilation checks
- citation consistency

---

### 4. Implementation Readiness

The following prerequisites for empirical execution are not yet satisfied:
- concrete representation family specifications
- engine lockfile and version pinning
- equivalence policy instantiations per experiment
- declared parameter grids tied to figure placeholders

Unlocking a coding agent before these contracts are frozen would risk architectural drift.

---

## Final Determination

- Manuscript mechanics may proceed.
- No experimental or code-generation agents may be unlocked until:
  - the manuscript narrative is complete
  - architectural contracts are finalized
  - experiment specifications are explicitly declared

This sequencing prevents the common failure mode where implementation silently reshapes conceptual intent.
