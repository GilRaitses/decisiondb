# Manuscript‑to‑architecture extraction
## Required objects

### Snapshot

“A snapshot is a bounded, immutable slice of inputs over a specified time window.”
“Snapshots represent frozen slices of the world over a declared time window.”

###     Representation

“A representation is a deterministic encoding of that snapshot, defined by explicit structural choices such as kernels, thresholds, weighting rules, or aggregation policies.”
“Representations are deterministic encodings of a snapshot. Each representation is generated by a declared factory and fully specified by its representation specification, namespace, and factory version.”

### Engine

“An engine is a fixed solver, simulator, or inference routine that consumes a representation and produces raw output.”
“Engine runs record executions of a fixed computational engine on a specific representation. Engine configuration and version are held constant across representational sweeps.”
Decision identity and equivalence policy

### Decision identity

“A decision is a discrete identity extracted from this output according to a declared equivalence policy.”
“The equivalence policy defines when two raw outputs are considered to represent the same decision identity, independent of incidental numerical differences.”
Decision‑valued map and decision maps

“The central object of study is a decision‑valued map f : R → D, where R denotes a family of representations over a fixed snapshot and D denotes a set of discrete decision identities.”
“Decision maps materialize the mapping between representations, engine runs, and decision identities. This table constitutes the empirical object of analysis and supports queries over persistence, boundary formation, and fracture.”

### System invariants
#### From Section 4 System Invariants:

“DecisionDB enforces four invariants.”
“Reproducibility requires identical inputs to yield identical identifiers.”
“Auditability requires that every mapping link to versioned artifacts and policies.”
“Separation ensures that representation parameters are not conflated with engine tuning.”
“Identity stability requires that decision identity be defined by policy rather than raw output.”

#### These four invariants are treated as infrastructure‑level constraints.

### Protocol stages
#### From Section 6 Experimental Protocol for Representational Sweeps:

“The diagnostic protocol proceeds in five stages.”
“First, a snapshot is frozen and assigned a content‑addressed identifier.”
“Second, a representation family is declared, along with a deterministic factory that generates individual representations from parameter settings.”
“Third, a sweep plan specifies the set of representational variants to be evaluated.”
“Fourth, the fixed engine is executed independently for each representation, producing raw outputs that are stored as immutable artifacts.”
“Fifth, a decision extractor applies a declared equivalence policy to produce discrete decision identities.”
“All artifacts are versioned and linked through content‑addressed identifiers. Representations are distinct from tuning parameters, and engine configuration is held fixed across the sweep.”
These five stages define the exact execution protocol for any DecisionDB representational sweep.

### Figure dependencies
#### From Sections 7 and 7.1:

Canonical visualization is defined as: “All empirical results in this work are expressed through a single canonical visualization of a representational sweep.”
Each visualization corresponds to “a fixed snapshot, a fixed engine, and a declared family of representations.”
Axes are “defined by explicit representation parameters drawn from the representation specification. Each evaluated representation occupies a single point in this parameter space.”
“Decision identity is encoded categorically, for example by color or region label. No continuous performance metric is displayed.”
“The visualization is constructed such that identical decision identities are visually grouped, making regions of persistence immediately apparent.”
“Boundaries correspond to loci where decision identity changes as representation parameters vary. Fractures correspond to abrupt identity changes induced by small representational variation.”
“All sweep visualizations conform to this structure. Differences between figures reflect differences in snapshots, engines, representation families, or equivalence policies, not changes in visualization semantics.”
#### From Section 11.1 onward, empirical result placeholders define figure‑level dependencies:

#### Example route: “Experiment ID: <EXP_ID_ROUTE> … Snapshot: <SNAPSHOT_ID> … Representation family: <REP_FAMILY> … Decision identities observed: <DECISION_ID_LIST>.”
#### Auditability: “Experiment ID: <EXP_ID_AUDIT> … Snapshot: <SNAPSHOT.ID> … Representation family: <REP_FAMILY> … Decision type: <DECISION.TYPE>.”
#### Persistence: “Experiment ID: <EXP_ID_PERSISTENCE> … Representation parameters swept: <PARAM_LIST>.”
#### Boundary localization: “Experiment ID: <EXP_ID_BOUNDARY> … Observed boundary parameters: <BOUNDARY_PARAM_RANGE>.”
#### These placeholders imply that each figure and empirical subsection depends on:

#### A concrete experiment ID.
#### A bound snapshot_id.
#### A specific representation family.
#### An engine and equivalence policy (stated elsewhere as fixed).
#### A materialized map from representation_id to decision identity for that experiment.
