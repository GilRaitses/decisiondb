\section{System Invariants}

DecisionDB enforces four invariants. First, reproducibility requires identical inputs to yield identical identifiers. Second, auditability requires that every mapping link to versioned artifacts and policies. Third, separation ensures that representation parameters are not conflated with engine tuning. Fourth, identity stability requires that decision identity be defined by policy rather than raw output.

By enforcing these constraints at the infrastructure level, DecisionDB supports empirical analysis of representational dependence without requiring reinterpretation of system behavior or rerunning engines post hoc.
