\caption{Canonical decision-valued mapping schematic. A fixed snapshot is encoded into a representation family. Each representation is executed by a fixed engine and yields raw output. An equivalence policy extracts a discrete decision identity from the raw output. The decision map links representation identifiers, engine runs, and decision identities.}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Primary representational sweep for one snapshot and engine. Each variant corresponds to a weight setting recorded in the weight variation results. Decision identity is defined by the route node sequence in each variant. Identical identities use the same label.}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Identity persistence regions derived from Figure 2. Consecutive variants with identical decision identity labels are shown as a single region, indicating persistence under the tested weight changes.}

\caption{Boundary and fracture localization derived from Figure 2. Transitions where route\_changed or edge\_order\_changed is true are marked as boundaries, with baseline and perturbed weight values listed.}
