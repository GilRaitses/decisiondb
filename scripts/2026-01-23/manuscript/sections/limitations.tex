\section{Failure Modes and Misinterpretations}

This section delineates the boundaries of applicability of the diagnostic framework and clarifies what claims are not made.

\subsection{Discrete Outcome Requirement}

DecisionDB applies only to systems where outputs can be reduced to discrete identities via a declared equivalence policy. Continuous outputs are out of scope unless such a reduction is explicitly defined.

\subsection{Fixed Snapshot and Engine Assumption}

All empirical results assume a frozen snapshot and a fixed engine. Changes to data, model parameters, or execution logic constitute a new analytical context and require a new analysis.

\subsection{No Claims About Optimization or Learning}

This framework does not improve outcomes, select better representations, or introduce learning dynamics. Any apparent performance effects observed in sweeps are incidental and not interpreted as optimization results.

\subsection{Empirical Coverage Limits}

Empirical Result Placeholder:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Representation families evaluated: \texttt{<REP\_FAMILY\_LIST>}
  \item Regions not evaluated: \texttt{<UNEXPLORED\_REGIONS>}
\end{itemize}

Reported sweeps cover only declared representation families and parameter ranges. Unobserved regions of representation space remain unconstrained.
