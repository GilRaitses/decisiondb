\section{Reviewer-Safe Figure Captions}

\textbf{Figure 1:} Schematic of the decision-valued mapping $f : \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$. A fixed snapshot is encoded into multiple representations, each consumed by a fixed engine. Discrete decision identities are extracted via an equivalence policy, making outcome dependence on representation explicit.

\textbf{Figure 2:} Example representational sweep showing regions of decision identity persistence and boundary formation. Each point corresponds to a representation variant; color indicates discrete decision identity.

\textbf{Figure 3:} System architecture for logging and replaying decision-valued maps. Content-addressed identifiers link snapshots, representations, engine runs, and decisions to ensure reproducibility and auditability.
