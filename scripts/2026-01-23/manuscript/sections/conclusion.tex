\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduced decision-valued maps as a diagnostic object for characterizing how discrete outcome identities depend on representational choices. The infrastructure described here supports logging, replaying, and auditing these dependencies without introducing optimization, learning, or performance claims. Making representational dependence observable is a prerequisite for reliable reasoning about discrete outcomes in complex systems.
