Complex analytical pipelines produce discrete outcome identities that depend on representational choices in ways that are rarely recorded or examined. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps as the central diagnostic object for making such dependencies observable. We describe a minimal infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing the mapping from representation families to discrete decision identities under fixed snapshots and engines. The empirical method employs canonical representational sweeps that partition representation space into regions of identity persistence and boundary formation. The contribution is infrastructural: a system-level abstraction that renders representational dependence empirically testable without introducing performance targets, learning dynamics, or outcome-improvement claims.
