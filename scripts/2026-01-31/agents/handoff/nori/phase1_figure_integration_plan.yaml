task_sequence:
  - step: 1
    action: verify_existing_assets
    instructions:
      - Confirm figures 1 to 4 exist at the listed paths.
      - Confirm no figure5 asset exists before creation.

  - step: 2
    action: define_figure5_artifact
    instructions:
      - Create fig5_replay_verification.yaml with a table spec derived from the replay verification logs.
      - Use only fields present in the logs.
      - Required table fields:
        - decision_id
        - policy_id
        - payload_hash
        - decision_id_hash
        - verdict
        - table_counts
      - Keep layout fixed and recorded in render_spec.

  - step: 3
    action: render_figure5_svg
    instructions:
      - Render figure5_replay_verification.svg from the YAML spec.
      - Use black and white only.
      - Fixed dimensions and no embellishments.

  - step: 4
    action: update_manifests
    instructions:
      - Add Figure 5 to artifacts_manifest.yaml.
      - Add Figure 5 to figure_inventory.yaml.
      - Add Figure 5 to figure_render_log.yaml.

  - step: 5

    instructions:
      - Replace placeholders in figure_placeholders.tex with figure environments.
      - Use includegraphics with paths relative to scripts/2026-01-23/manuscript.
      - Suggested relative path prefix:
        - ../2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/figures/
      - Keep captions aligned with phase1_figure_captions.md.
      - If SVG inclusion fails, add a minimal main.tex change to enable SVG support or convert to PDF under scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/figures and update paths.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Figures 1 to 5 exist as assets under scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/figures/.
  - Figure 5 artifact spec is present and reproducible from YAML alone.
  - figure_placeholders.tex includes figure environments for Figures 1 to 5.
  - No changes outside the scoped manuscript files and work-tree outputs.

      - Define a table with fields from the replay verification logs:
          decision_id, policy_id, payload_hash, decision_id_hash,
          policy_id_hash, database table counts, verdict.
      - Render scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/figures/figure5_replay_verification.svg

    steps:
      - Replace placeholders in figure_placeholders.tex with LaTeX figure blocks
        that include the figure assets for Figures 1 to 5.
      - Use relative paths from scripts/2026-01-23/manuscript to

    name: Record integration completion
    steps:
      - Add a short integration report under
