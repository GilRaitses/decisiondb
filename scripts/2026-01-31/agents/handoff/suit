Phase 0 handoff
DecisionDB repo freeze audit and file index

Goal
Create a repo-accurate index of files and runnable entrypoints for the frozen commit. Produce only facts.

Inputs
Repo path or checkout location. Frozen commit hash or tag. If unknown, the agent must record the current HEAD hash.

Outputs
One YAML file. Name it phase0_index.yaml.

Rules
No design suggestions. No refactors. No patch plan. No schema guesses. No prose beyond short field strings. No comma-and lists in descriptions.

What to enumerate
Every file under these categories. Each file listed as a separate entry.

Source code
Python, notebooks, scripts.

Build artifacts
LaTeX, Quarto, markdown, figures, bibliography, makefiles.

Configs
YAML, JSON, TOML, env templates, CI.

Data interface stubs
Any sample data, schema files, fixtures.

Entrypoints
Any CLI, make target, task runner, notebook cell that triggers pipeline steps.

For each file entry include
path
type
role one short noun phrase
owner module if obvious from folder
last_modified if available
size_bytes if available
public_safe boolean default false

For each entrypoint include
name
command
workdir
inputs list of paths
outputs list of paths
env_vars list of names
requires_gpu boolean
public_safe boolean default false

Validation
Agent must confirm every referenced path exists. Agent must confirm every command references existing files. No execution required yet.

Stop condition
Stop after phase0_index.yaml is produced. Do not proceed to Phase 1.
