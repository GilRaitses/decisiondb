phase: 3
status: planning
intent:
  - Demonstrate how Phase 2 reuse conditions apply to real inference traces.
  - Validate that defined observables surface reuse breakdown without new mechanisms.
  - Prepare material suitable for internal review or external manuscript framing.

inputs:
  - phase1_5_figures
  - phase2_compatibility_conditions
  - phase2_reuse_invariants
  - phase2_failure_conditions
  - phase2_observables_map

non_goals:
  - No infrastructure implementation.
  - No new data collection.
  - No model retraining or recalibration.
  - No optimization or performance claims.

expected_outputs:
  - Trace-level walkthroughs showing reuse acceptance and rejection.
  - Mapping from observables to failure conditions using existing figures.
  - Short narrative examples suitable for memo or manuscript inclusion.

constraints:
  - Use only frozen Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 artifacts.
  - Do not introduce new abstractions or terminology.
  - Maintain declarative framing throughout.
  - Avoid prescriptive language.

review_criteria:
  - Does each example make reuse decisions legible?
  - Are observables sufficient to explain outcomes?
  - Is confidence interpretability preserved or lost in a traceable way?

handoff_rules:
  - All work stored under scripts/YYYY-MM-DD/agents/work-tree/.
  - YAML for structured artifacts.
  - Natural language only for narrative walkthroughs.
