phase: phase_7
name: followup_execution
status: authorized_pending_start
depends_on:
  - phase_6_submission_bundle_frozen

intent:
  Execute the first follow-up paper using only claim seeds and outlines
  produced in Phase 6, without modifying or extending submitted claims.

scope:
  include:
    - followup_paper_outline.yaml
    - followup_claim_seeds.yaml
    - phase5_hardened_claims.yaml
    - phase4_trace_artifacts
  exclude:
    - changes to Phase 1–6 manuscripts
    - new empirical claims
    - new figures requiring data not already materialized

objectives:
  - Expand followup_paper_outline into a full draft manuscript
  - Map each section explicitly to existing claim seeds
  - Identify which claims require additional evidence versus exposition only
  - Produce a submission-ready draft or a clearly scoped gap report

deliverables:
  required:
    - agents/work-tree/followup_manuscript_draft.tex
    - agents/work-tree/followup_claim_to_section_map.yaml
    - agents/work-tree/followup_evidence_gap_report.yaml
    - agents/work-tree/phase7_completion_report.yaml
  optional:
    - agents/work-tree/followup_figures_manifest.yaml

guardrails:
  - Do not revise, reinterpret, or restate Phase 6 claims
  - Do not introduce new terminology that reframes alignment scope
  - Do not add citations that imply dependency on unpublished results
  - Do not create new datasets, simulations, or traces
  - Treat Phase 6 submission as immutable

execution_steps:
  - Load followup_paper_outline.yaml as structural skeleton
  - For each section, bind text to followup_claim_seeds.yaml entries
  - Mark any section that cannot be completed without new evidence
  - Produce draft text in neutral academic register
  - Record all decisions and omissions explicitly in gap report

validation:
  checks:
    - every section maps to at least one existing claim seed
    - no claim appears that is absent from Phase 5 or Phase 6 artifacts
    - language does not weaken or extend original scope
  failure_conditions:
    - draft introduces new claims
    - draft depends on future experimental results
    - draft alters interpretation of submitted work

handoff_criteria:
  success:
    - draft is internally coherent
    - all gaps are explicitly enumerated
    - follow-up paper can be scheduled without revisiting Phase 6
  next_phase:
    - phase_8_revision_or_parallel_execution
