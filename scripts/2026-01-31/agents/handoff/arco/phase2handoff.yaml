  scope: formalization_and_analysis_only

objective:
  Formalize compatibility conditions and reuse criteria implied by Phase 1.5 artifacts,
  using the existing figures as fixed anchors. Phase 2 makes explicit the conditions
  under which confidence reuse is admissible and the boundaries where reuse fails,
  focused on decision context, abstraction level, task framing, and input regime.

scope_intent:
  summary: Formalize reuse admissibility and failure boundaries from fixed figures.

constraints:
  hard:
    - Do not modify or regenerate Phase 1.5 figures or specs.
    - Do not introduce new diagrams.
    - Do not introduce training, optimization, or reward-related concepts.
    - Do not introduce capability, calibration, or evaluation tooling concepts.
    - Do not propose new infrastructure, storage systems, or APIs.
    - Do not restate Phase 1 concepts; build directly on them.
  soft:
    - Keep all outputs interpretable as analysis artifacts, not product designs.
    - Prefer invariants, conditions, and interfaces over narratives.

tasks:
  - name: compatibility_formalization
    description: >
      Define explicit compatibility conditions under which confidence may be reused
      across tasks and timescales, grounded in the decision context elements shown in
      Phase 1.5 figures, with conditions framed by decision context, abstraction level,
      task framing, and input regime.
    outputs:
      - scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/compatibility_conditions.yaml

  - name: reuse_invariants
    description: >
      Identify invariants that must hold for confidence reuse to remain interpretable.
      Express these as logical or structural constraints tied to abstraction level,
      task framing, input regime, and decision context.
    outputs:
      - scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/reuse_invariants.yaml

  - name: boundary_characterization
    description: >
      Formalize boundary and fracture conditions where reuse fails, corresponding
      directly to fig4_boundary_fracture.
    outputs:
      - scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/reuse_failure_conditions.yaml

  - name: observables_mapping
    description: >
      Specify what becomes observable at each decision boundary and which violations
      surface when compatibility checks fail.
    outputs:
      - scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/observables_map.yaml

deliverables:
  required:
    - compatibility_conditions.yaml
    - reuse_invariants.yaml
    - reuse_failure_conditions.yaml
    - observables_map.yaml
  optional:
    - phase2_summary.yaml

storage_rules:

  work_tree: scripts/2026-01-31/agents/work-tree/
  format: yaml_only

success_criteria:
  - All outputs reference Phase 1.5 artifacts explicitly.
  - No new diagrams are required to understand the analysis.
  - A reviewer can determine reuse admissibility from the written conditions alone.
  - A reviewer can answer when reuse no longer holds without inference.
