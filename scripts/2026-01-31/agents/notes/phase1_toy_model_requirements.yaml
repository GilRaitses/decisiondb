figures_requiring_toy_artifacts:
  - figure_id: 1
    figure_name: Canonical Decision-Valued Mapping Schematic
    requirement_type: synthetic_diagram
    reason: No existing schematic asset in repository. Only textual definitions are present.
    source_files:
      - scripts/2026-01-23/manuscript/sections/core_object.tex
      - scripts/2026-01-23/manuscript/sections/protocol.tex

  - figure_id: 2
    figure_name: Primary Representational Sweep
    requirement_type: reduced_scope_toy_sweep
    reason: No full sweep artifacts in repository. Use a minimal sweep from weight variation results.
    source_files:
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_neighbor_weight_activated_results.json
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_second_order_weight_activated_results.json
  - figure_id: 3
    figure_name: Identity Persistence Regions
    requirement_type: derived_toy_regions
    reason: Requires aggregation of sweep variants into persistence regions. No standalone artifact exists.

      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_second_order_weight_activated_results.json
  - figure_id: 4
    figure_name: Boundary and Fracture Localization
    requirement_type: derived_toy_boundaries
    reason: Requires explicit boundary annotations from route_changed and edge_order_changed fields. No standalone artifact exists.

    figure_name: Reproducibility Replay Verification
    reuse_sources:
      - scripts/2026-01-24/agents/handoff/king-dolphin/0647-barbara-replay_verification_exec_report.yaml
      - scripts/2026-01-24/agents/work-tree/barbara/0647-replay_verification.yaml
    reason: Replay verification evidence is already logged with recomputed identifiers and table counts.
