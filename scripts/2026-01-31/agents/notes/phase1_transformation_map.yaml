    transformation_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: Extract entities and relations defined for snapshot, representation, engine run, equivalence policy, decision identity, and decision map.
      - step: 2
        action: Draft a schematic with nodes for the entities and links in the order snapshot, representation, engine run, raw output, equivalence policy, decision identity, decision map.
      - step: 3
        action: Label each link with the artifact type described in the source text.
    output:
      type: diagram
      intent: Canonical decision-valued mapping schematic for Figure 1.
  - id: fig2_primary_sweep
    figure_id: 2
    figure_name: Primary Representational Sweep
    source_files:
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_neighbor_weight_activated_results.json
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_second_order_weight_activated_results.json
    transformation_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: For each results file, read baseline and perturbed path_nodes with the associated weight values.
      - step: 2
        action: Assign a decision identity label using exact path_nodes sequence equality only.
      - step: 3
        action: Order variants by the recorded weight change to form a minimal sweep axis.
      - step: 4
        action: Render a small grid or table with one row per variant and a symbol per decision identity label.
    output:
      type: table_or_grid
      intent: Minimal representational sweep for Figure 2.
  - id: fig3_identity_persistence
    figure_id: 3
    figure_name: Identity Persistence Regions
    source_files:
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_neighbor_weight_activated_results.json
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_second_order_weight_activated_results.json
    transformation_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: Start from the ordered sweep table produced for Figure 2.
      - step: 2
        action: Group consecutive variants with identical decision identity labels.
      - step: 3
        action: Render grouped variants as contiguous regions with labels that match Figure 2.
    output:
      type: region_strip
      intent: Identity persistence regions derived from Figure 2.
  - id: fig4_boundary_fracture
    figure_id: 4
    figure_name: Boundary and Fracture Localization
    source_files:
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_neighbor_weight_activated_results.json
      - scripts/2026-01-16/artifacts/pearson_second_order_weight_activated_results.json
    transformation_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: Read route_changed and edge_order_changed flags for each weight variation.
      - step: 2
        action: Mark boundaries at the weight transitions where route_changed is true.
      - step: 3
        action: Annotate boundaries with the baseline and perturbed weight values only.
    output:
      type: annotated_strip_or_table
      intent: Boundary and fracture localization derived from Figure 2.
