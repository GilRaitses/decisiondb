results:
  - check_name: scope_containment
    pass_fail: pass
    blocking_issue: false
    notes: No training, optimization, reward, calibration, evaluation tooling, storage, API, infrastructure, or product naming detected in Phase 2 outputs. Content stays within decision context, abstraction level, task framing, and input regime anchored to fig1 to fig4.
  - check_name: artifact_anchoring
    pass_fail: pass
    blocking_issue: false
    notes: Every condition, invariant, and failure mode cites fig1 to fig4 evidence fields. No condition lacks a figure reference. observables_map.yaml observables and decision_boundaries reference related conditions and fig2 to fig4 boundary entries.
  - check_name: terminology_consistency
    pass_fail: pass
    blocking_issue: false
    notes: confidence and reuse are used consistently in admissibility and failure logic. compatibility appears in artifact naming only and does not conflict. context usage refers to source or target context without synonyms. traceability is not used, so no conflicting synonym appears.
  - check_name: reviewer_answerability
    pass_fail: pass
    blocking_issue: false
    notes: Reuse admissible when all conditions in compatibility_conditions.yaml hold under admissibility_logic all_of. Reuse must stop when any failure condition in reuse_failure_conditions.yaml holds under failure_logic any_of. Boundary observables are route_changed_flag, edge_order_changed_flag, and decision_identity_label listed in observables_map.yaml decision_boundaries. Not automatic: identity persistence across boundaries is broken when route_changed or edge_order_changed is true, and task framing must preserve the identity label, per reuse_invariants.
  - check_name: manuscript_readiness
    pass_fail: pass
    blocking_issue: false
    notes: Each YAML file is a bounded list of conditions, invariants, failures, and observables with figure evidence. No calibration or logging framing required to avoid misreading. The set can be placed in an appendix without modification.
