  description: Confidence reuse fails when any failure condition holds.
failure_conditions:
  decision_context:
    - id: equivalence_policy_changed
      trigger: Equivalence policy used for decision identity is not the same as the source context.
      evidence:
        - fig1_canonical_schematic.links.policy_to_identity
    - id: decision_identity_label_changed
      trigger: Decision identity label differs between source and target contexts.
      evidence:
        - fig2_primary_sweep.decision_labels
        - fig3_identity_persistence.regions
  abstraction_level:
    - id: representation_stage_changed
      trigger: Representation stage differs from the canonical mapping.
      evidence:
        - fig1_canonical_schematic.entities.representation
  task_framing:
    - id: framing_remaps_identity
      trigger: Task framing maps to a different decision identity label under the same equivalence rule.
      evidence:
        - fig2_primary_sweep.decision_label_rule
        - fig2_primary_sweep.decision_labels
  input_regime:
    - id: boundary_route_changed
      trigger: Transition shows route_changed true.
      evidence:
        - fig4_boundary_fracture.boundaries
    - id: boundary_edge_order_changed
      trigger: Transition shows edge_order_changed true.
      evidence:
        - fig4_boundary_fracture.boundaries
    - id: outside_identity_region
      trigger: Parameter value lies outside the identity persistence region for the label.
