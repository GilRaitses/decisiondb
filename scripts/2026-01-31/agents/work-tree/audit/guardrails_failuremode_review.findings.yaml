    area: lint
    description: Abstract lint fails to parse phase_crosslineage_map.yaml due to YAML ScannerError at figure_concept_alignment values containing unquoted colons.
    evidence_pointer: console_log CMD "python scripts/2026-01-31/agents/tools/abstract_lint.py /tmp/abstractlint_empty_dir"

    severity: note
    area: permissions
    description: phase_crosslineage_map.yaml is writable (mode 100644) and does not carry a read-only signal.
