  blocking_issues:
    - abstract_lint_behavior fails due to YAML parse error in phase_crosslineage_map.yaml
    - diff_base_correctness uses origin/main only and does not reference PR base ref
  recommended_fix:
    - quote colon-bearing strings in phase_crosslineage_map.yaml or adjust linter to tolerate them without modifying the map
    - update CI diff scope to use base ref semantics for PRs while preserving push behavior
  merge_recommendation: do_not_merge_until_blockers_resolved
  freeze_declaration_text: phase_crosslineage_map.yaml remains invariant with override gate
