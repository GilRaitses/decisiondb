\section{Motivation and scope boundary}
This follow up manuscript is scoped to the claim seeds listed in followup_claim_seeds.yaml.
It does not modify or extend the submitted claims from Phase 5.
The purpose is to structure follow up text around existing claim identifiers and trace coverage.

Claim PC1 (verbatim): Decision identity assignment depends on the equivalence policy and the canonical mapping chain.
Claim PC2 (verbatim): Decision identity labels are assigned by exact path_nodes sequence equality across sweep variants.

\section{Trace coverage expansion plan}
This section is limited to describing how existing traces support the claim seeds without adding new evidence.
The current trace set remains the Phase 4 extended trace set.
Any expansion beyond that trace set is out of scope for this phase and is listed in the evidence gap report.

Claim PC3 (verbatim): Confidence reuse is admissible when decision identity labels remain constant within identity persistence regions and no boundary crossing is observed.
Claim TC4 (verbatim): Confidence reuse is inadmissible when crossing sweeps with a decision identity label change.

\section{Observables and boundary visibility}
This section uses the existing observables defined in observables_map.yaml.
No new observables or terminology are introduced.

Claim PC4 (verbatim): Confidence reuse is inadmissible across boundary transitions with route_changed or edge_order_changed true.
Claim TC5 (verbatim): Confidence reuse is inadmissible when the equivalence policy reference differs across contexts.

\section{Open questions and limitations}
Open questions are enumerated without adding new claims or mechanisms.
Any question that would require new evidence is recorded in the evidence gap report.
This section remains bounded by the existing claims and trace evidence.
