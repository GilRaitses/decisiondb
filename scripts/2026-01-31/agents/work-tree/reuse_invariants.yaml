invariants:
  decision_context:
    - id: identity_defined_by_path_nodes
      invariant: Decision identity equality is defined by exact path_nodes sequence equality.
      evidence:
        - fig2_primary_sweep.decision_label_rule.method
    - id: identity_depends_on_equivalence_policy
      invariant: Equivalence policy is a required input to decision identity assignment.
      evidence:
        - fig1_canonical_schematic.links.policy_to_identity
    - id: decision_map_inputs_fixed
      invariant: Decision map depends only on representation and decision identity.
      evidence:
        - fig1_canonical_schematic.links.representation_to_map
        - fig1_canonical_schematic.links.identity_to_map
  abstraction_level:
    - id: single_representation_stage
      invariant: Representation is a single stage in the canonical mapping.
      evidence:
        - fig1_canonical_schematic.entities.representation
  task_framing:
    - id: framing_tied_to_identity_label
      invariant: Task framing must preserve the identity label for reuse to remain interpretable.
      evidence:
        - fig2_primary_sweep.decision_labels
        - fig3_identity_persistence.regions
  input_regime:
    - id: identity_persists_within_regions
      invariant: Within each identity persistence region, the decision label is constant.
      evidence:
        - fig3_identity_persistence.regions
    - id: boundary_crossing_breaks_identity
      invariant: A boundary with route_changed or edge_order_changed true breaks identity persistence.
      evidence:
        - fig4_boundary_fracture.boundaries
        - fig2_primary_sweep.sweeps
