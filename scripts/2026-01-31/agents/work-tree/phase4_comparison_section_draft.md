# Comparison to adjacent framings

- Calibration is not addressed. The work does not adjust confidence values and only states when reuse is admissible.
- Logging is not addressed. Observables are fixed to existing figures and do not define data collection.
- Evaluation is not addressed. No performance metrics or claims appear in Phase 4 outputs.
- Model performance is not a decision basis. Reuse decisions follow conditions and observables only.
