Trace 1 covers the neighbor_weight sweep with second_order_weight fixed at 0.25. The baseline and perturbed variants carry decision identity label A under the path_nodes sequence recorded in fig2. The fig4 boundary for 0.5 to 1.0 records route_changed false and edge_order_changed false, and fig3 shows label A across that neighbor_weight range. Under the Phase 2 compatibility conditions, confidence reuse is admissible for this trace.

Trace 2 covers the second_order_weight sweep with neighbor_weight fixed at 0.5. The baseline variant carries label A and the perturbed variant carries label B with a different path_nodes sequence in fig2. The fig4 boundary at 0.25 to 0.5 records route_changed true and edge_order_changed true, and fig3 shows a boundary between label A at 0.25 and label B at 0.5. Under the Phase 2 failure conditions, confidence reuse is inadmissible for this trace and the boundary observables make the change visible.
